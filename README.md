# Christmas Competition 2022

## Getting Started

Hopefully this all works, but it's very possibly missing something. Let me know if you have any issues and I'll help troubleshoot.

1. Clone the repo and run `npm i` to install dependencies
1. Create a .env file in the root of the project and that will hold the following:

   ```
   JWT_ACCESS_SECRET=<anything you want>
   DATABASE_URL=<url for an empty postgres database>
   SHADOW_DATABASE_URL=<might not need this, but if you do, a second empty postgres database url>
   ```

   For DATABASE_URL, you'll have to create an empty postgres database.
   If your default template uses extensions, it may give you issues (it gave me issues), in which case create your database using template0. If that's the case, you'll probably also need to manually create the shadow database prisma uses to detect issues with any schema changes. If you know how to do this without issue go for it and ignore the following. Here's how I did it, possibly badly, using psql from the command line.

   1. `psql`
   1. `CREATE DATABASE xmas2022 TEMPLATE template0;`
   1. `CREATE DATABASE xmas2022shadow TEMPLATE template0;`
   1. `\q`
   1. You'll need a user and password for the database. I used the same ones I'm using for my other local databases, which seems to be working.
   1. The url strings take the form `postgres://<user>:<password>@localhost:5432/<database name>`

1. To sync the database with the schema, run `npx prisma migrate dev`. If it works, you shouldn't get any errors, and your database should match the schema in `prisma/schema.prisma`.
1. I think you'll need to generate the prisma client with `npx prisma generate`. It creates files in `node_modules/.prisma` that are used by the app. Kinda weird if you ask me, but that's how it works.
1. You should be able to explore your database with `npx prisma studio`, similar to the Django admin (but tbh not nearly as nice).
1. Run `npm run sync && npm run dev -- --open` to tell SvelteKit to create its files, start the dev server, and open the app in your browser.

## Notes

The current app doesn't have a lot, but that should make it a good starting point for trying to get a sense for how things are working together. Currently, it just allows signup and login, which gives access to the guarded page. It doesn't even have logout yet, but to do that you can manually remove the cookie in the browser dev tools.

### Troubleshooting

Sometimes I find I need to manually run `npm run sync` to get SvelteKit to regenerate types, especially with new code. If you're getting a bunch of errors or red squigglies, try that.

Don't wait long before asking for help. These instructions are untested, and in general if you're spinning your wheels on something with this stack there's a good chance I have too.

### Types

The vast majority of the types needed are generated by Prisma and SvelteKit, so you mostly get to enjoy great type hints. The SvelteKit types will typically come from if not autogenerated '@sveltejs/kit' or './$types' if autogenerated. Prisma's types come from the schema and generally just work.

### Prisma

As we develop the schema, we'll modify `schema.prisma` then run `npx prisma migrate dev` to create a new migration file and update the database. If you pull down changes from the repo with migrations, you'll run `npx prisma migrate dev` to update your database.

### Svelte

To get a quick feel for Svelte, you can go to https://component-party.dev/ and see some common components alongside Vue equivalents. The Svelte docs are good.

### SvelteKit

The SvelteKit docs are pretty good but also much younger and error messages aren't always great. Let me know if you run into anything. Here's a quick introduction to what you'll see:

The `hooks.server.ts` file exports a `handle` function that gets called on every request. Currently it's used to check for an auth cookie and populate `locals.user` if a user is logged in (has a valid cookie).

The site's urls are generated based on the folders within the routes folders (and can be nested from there).

For there to be a page, there will be a `+page.svelte` file in the folder.

If there's a `+page.ts` file, it will run on both the server and the client and can export a `load` function that will get passed to `+page.svelte` as a prop named `data`.

If there's a `+page.server.ts` file, it will only run on the server and can export a `load` function that will also get passed to `+page.svelte` as a prop named `data`. If you have both `+page.ts` and `+page.server.ts`, you might need to pass the data from one to the other. Currently, you can see these checking whether `locals.user` exists and possibly redirecting accordingly.

A `+page.server.ts` file can also export an `actions` object that can respond to requests. For instance, if you have a `default` function in the `actions` object, it will get called from a form in the `+page.svelte` at that route. You can also name action functions, which will correspond to a form's `action` attribute, and you can hit those endpoints across routes and so on. Currently, you can see this in use for the login and signup forms.

Everything in the `lib` file can be imported as `$lib/<file name>`.
